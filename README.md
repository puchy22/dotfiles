# Software

In this section you can find the basic software that I usually use in my desktops enviorements.
This is independent of the linux distribution you use. For example I used to use bspwm and kitty in my Arch Linux deskptop for daily use and Qtile and Alacritty in my parrotOS virtual machines.

List of common software:

- nvim
- [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/)
- [picom](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Picom)
- [flameshot](https://flameshot.org/)
- [arandr](https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/)
- thunar

## WM

### Bspwm

In the case of this wm is specified to work with feh to display a wallpaper, [polybar](#Polybar) as status bar, picom for window transparencies, 
[rofi](#Rofi) to run differents programs and kitty as terminal emulator.

More info in [Wiki](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm).

#### Specific key binds

In this table are the keybinds most used by me that are not found in [keybindings](#Keybindings). You can change these keys editing the sxhdrc file .

### Qtile 

## Polybar

I mainly use polybar with bspwm. To use this you need to install a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to be able to display the emojis (in my case I use Iosevka).
At the beginning of the file are defined the main colors that you can use in the rest of the file. 
The next part is the definition of the principal bar and another for a second monitor. The only different between boht are the emojis and some modules like battery.

## Rofi
